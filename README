This is the README file for xnetload 1.6 for Linux.

Purpose
-------
This program displays network traffic and uptime for the network connection
named on the command line. I originally wrote it to monitor my dial-up
connection. It requires the /proc file system! It can use IP-accounting if
it's available. 

Changes 
------- 
version 1.5.1
- Updated the program to use the new /proc/net/dev layout in the 2.1.9x
  kernels. This also works with the 2.2.x kernels.

version 1.5.0
- Added a patch from Tony Mancill<tmancill@debian.org> to issue
  IP-accounting rules if necessary. 
- Changed the graphs to display log10 of the packet/byte count.

version 1.4.2
- Changed my e-mail address. The old address (rsmit06@ibm.net) will become
  invalid in juli '98.

version 1.4.1
- Added patch level for bug-fixing :-)
- Fixed a out-of bounds string write bug in `read_ip_acct'. Thanks to
  Don May <d.may@computer.org> for spotting this.

version 1.4
- Fixed a bug in the code for calculating the average.
- Code separated into data-gathering and user-interface.
  (I'm thinking on adding a GTK+ interface for the next release, it would
   be a compile-time choice between Xaw/GTK+ interface)
- Modified it to make it work with 2.1.xx kernels.
  Thanks to Adrian Bridgett <adrian.bridgett@poboxes.com> for sending in
  this patch.
- Added a fix to make it work with IP-aliases. Thanks to Raphael Wegmann
  <wegmann@mail.psi.co.at> for contributing it.
- It display bytes/s if IP-accounting is enabled.
  Tony Mancill <tmancill@debian.org> submitted the basic code.
- Displays bytes/s on a kernel that supports it. (2.1.xx)
- The period over which the packet count is averaged can be changed in the
  makefile.

Version 1.3 employs some code for snooping on sockets. It wasn't publicly
released, since it was a CPU hog, and only works on AF_UNIX type sockets.

version 1.2:
- Fixed a bug in reading large packet counts.
  (Thanks to Rik Hemsley for spotting these.)
- Added library and include-file paths to the makefile. 
- Added Strip-Charts to display graphs of the network traffic.
- Added resources and command-line options to make it more configurable.

version 1.1:
- The program now responds to the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message (by terminating
  itself).

Files
-----
The distribution should contain the following files:
LICENSE         GNU General Public License.
Makefile        Makefile for GNU make.
README          :-)
XNetload        Application defaults file for xnetload
data.c          Data-collecting code.
data.h          Header for data collecting code.
x11-ui.c        Xt/Xaw user interface code.

Building and installing the program
----------------------------------
- If you want to change the period over which xnetload averages packet and
  byte counts, change the macro definition -DNUMAVG=5 in the CFLAGS 
  in the makefile. The default is 5 seconds (NUMAVG=5)
- To build the program invoke 'make'.
- Optionally strip the binary to save some disk space: 'strip xnetload'.
- To install the program, invoke 'make install' *as root*.
- Optionally, edit the application-defaults file (XNetload), and copy it
  (as root) to a place where X can find it. Usually a "app-defaults" 
  directory in the X directory tree. On my system it is the
  /var/X11R6/lib/app-defaults/ directory.


If you don't like it, login as root, change to the source directory and run
'make uninstall'. After that you can remove the source tree.

I only release source code packages. IMHO this is the best way to work
around library versions and related difficulties. (It also means that other
people, using the source, can find the bugs that I overlooked :-) If you
want to build a binary package, by all means do so, but please identify it
as your doing and responsibility.
