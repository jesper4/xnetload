.SH NAME
xnetload \- Displays packet (or bytes) traffic and uptime for a
network connection in an X window.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xnetload
[Xt options] [other options]
.I interface

.SH DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents version 1.11 of \fBxnetload\fP, a program that
displays the number of bytes (or packets) transmitted per second in
and out of the system over a network connection, in an X window. If the
interface it is assigned to monitor goes offline, xnetload terminates itself.

The first line of test displays the interface that this instance of
xnetload is monitoring, and the amount of time that has passed since the
program was started. This is very useful to keep track of how long you've
been online in case of a dail-up connection.  Displaying this line can be
turned off by using the \fB-ni\fP switch or setting the \fBnoInterface\fP
resource to True.

Next follow a line of text showing the incoming bytes. Three numbers are
shown; the current value, the maximum value seen in this session (between
()), and the amount of bytes received (between []). Showing this line can
be turned off by using the \fB-nv\fP switch or setting the \fBnoValues\fP
resource to True. The number of bytes is averaged over the last five
samples by default. Also by default, the samples are taken and the screen
is updated every second.

Below that is a graphical representation of the incoming stream. The graph
displays log10 of the numbers of bytes by default, but it can also show the
amount in kilobytes (by using the \fB-kb\fP switch). The kilobytes value
can be scaled by a command-line parameter (\fB-s\fP \fIfactor\fP).

The line of text and the graph are repeated for outgoing bytes.

This program requires the /proc filesystem. If you want to display (k)bytes/s
you'll need a 2.1.x kernel or newer kernel. As of version 1.7.0, support
for ip-accounting for 2.0.x kernels is dropped. Version 1.6.1 is still
available for those wishing to use ip-accounting on a 2.0.x kernel.

.SH OPTIONS
This program accepts the standard X Toolkit Intrinsics options (see X(1)).

In addition, it accepts the following specific options:
.TP
\fB-?\fP or \fB-h\fP or \fB--help\fP or no arguments
This prints a short help message.
.TP
\fB-novalues\fP or \fB-nv\fP
This inhibits showing the traffic numbers.
.TP
\fB-nointerface\fP or \fB-ni\fP
This inhibits showing of the "interface" line at the top of the
window. Combining  \fB-nv\fP and \fB-ni\fP comes in handy when using
xnetload as a dock applet. 
.TP
\fB-nocharts\fP or \fB-nc\fP
This inhibits the display of packet traffic graphs.
.TP
\fB-kilobytes\fP or \fB-kb\fP
Display the chart/values as kilobytes. This doesn't work on a 2.0.x
kernel, since there is no byte count in /proc/net/dev in those kernels.
.TP
\fB-scale\fP \fIfactor\fP or \fB-s\fP \fIfactor\fP
Scales the kilobytes display by a given value, which must be > 1. Used in
combination with \fB-kilobytes\fP or \fB-kb\fP.
.TP
\fB-u\fP \fIseconds\fP, \fB-update\fP  \fIseconds\fP
Number of seconds between screen updates. The default is 1 second.
.TP
\fB-a\fP \fIcount\fP or \fB-average\fP  \fIcount\fP
The number of samples that is averaged. The values and graphs show this
average. The default value is 5 samples.
.TP
\fB-interface\fP \fIinterface\fP or \fB-if\fP \fIinterface\fP or \fIinterface\fP 
The name of the network \fIinterface\fP to monitor, e.g.
.B lo
for the loopback device, or
.B sl0
for the first slip device.
.TP
\fB-zeroonreset\fP or \fB-zr\fP
Resets the counters to zero, if the interface has gone down, or the counter
in the kernel has rolled over.

.SH RESOURCES
Next to the resources available to the widget, xnetload also defines
the following custom application resources:
.TP 
\fBinterface\fP (class \fBInterface\fP)
The name of the network interface to monitor. This is set by the
command-line option \fB-if\fP.
.TP
\fBnoValues\fP (class \fBNoValues\fP) 
This is a boolean value that, if True, inhibits the display of the packet
count value. It defaults to \fBFalse\fP. This resource can be set to True
on the command-line by specifying the \fB-nv\fP option.
.TP
\fBnoInterface\fP (class \fBNoInterface\fP) 
This is a boolean value that, if True, inhibits the display of the
interface line at the top of the window. It defaults to \fBFalse\fP. 
This resource can be set to True on the command-line by specifying the 
\fB-ni\fP option.
.TP
\fBnoCharts\fP (class \fBNoCharts\fP) 
This is a boolean value that, if True, inhibits the display of the packet
count graph. It defaults to \fBFalse\fP. Specifying the \fB-nc\fP option on
the command-line sets this resource to True.
.TP
\fBkilobytes\fP (class \fBKilobytes\fP)
This boolean makes the program convert the values it reads to kilobytes.
It defaults to \fBFalse\fP. Specifying the \fB-kb\fP
option on the command-line sets this resource to True.
.TP
\fBscale\fP (class \fBScale\fP)
This value makes the program scale the graph by the given amount, if the
graph is showing kilobytes. This resource can also be specified on the
command-line via the \fB-s\fP option.
.TP
\fBupd\fP (class \fBUpd\fP)
Number of seconds between updates. This resource can also be set on the
command-line with the \fB-u\fP or \fB-update\fP option.
.TP
\fBagv\fP (class \fBAvg\fP)
The number of samples that is averaged. This resource can also be set on
the command-line with the \fB-a\fP or \fB-average\fP option.
.TP
\fBzeroOnReset\fP (class \fBZeroOnReset\fP)
Resets the counters to zero, if the interface has gone down, or the counter
in the kernel has rolled over. This resource can also be set on
the command-line with the \fB-zr\fP or \fB-zeroonreset\fP option.

.SH WIDGETS
The widget tree for \fIxnetload\fP is as shown below. It shows the widget
class name followed by the widget instance name.

.nf
XNetload xnetload
   Paned paned
       Label interface
       Label in
       StripChart str_in
       Label out
       StripChart str_out
.fi

If the \fB-nocharts\fP option is given, or the \fBnoCharts\fP resource is
set to True, the StripCharts are missing. 

If the \fB-novalues\fP option is given, or the \fBnoValues\fP resource is
set to True, the Labels \fIin\fP and \fIout\fP are missing.

If the \fB-nointerface\fP option is given, or the \fBnoInterface\fP resource is
set to True, the Label \fIinterface\fP is missing.

.SH FILES
.I /proc/net/dev 
-- network device statistics for Linux.

.I XNetload
-- application defaults file.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following messages can be generated on the console:
.TP
.B No network interface specified
The \fIinterface\fP argument on the command line was omitted.
.TP
.B Could not open /proc/net/dev
Opening the /proc/net/dev file failed. xnetload reads the data it displays
from this file. Make sure it exists and is readable. Try `cat
/proc/net/dev'. If this returns the error `No such file or directory' you
need to enable the /proc filesystem in the Linux kernel.
.TP
.B Interface not found in /proc/net/dev
The interface you've specified is not listed in /proc/net/dev.
Try `cat /proc/net/dev' and see what interfaces are
listed. Maybe you misspelled the name?
.TP
.B Error scanning /proc/net/dev
There was an error scanning the counts from /proc/net/dev.
There might have been a change in the format of these
files (especially in the development kernels).
Please send the maintainer a listing of that file.
.TP
.B Not enough memory to read /proc/net/dev
The program couldn't allocate enough memory to contain the whole
/proc/net/dev file.
.TP
.B Average count must be > 0
You specified a negative number with the  \fB-a\fP or \fB-average\fP
options, or the \fBavg\fP resource. This is not allowed.
.TP
.B Scale must be > 1
You specified a small or negative number with the  \fB-s\fP or \fB-scale\fP
options, or the \fBscale\fP resource. This is not allowed.
.TP
.B Update time must be > 0
You specified a negative number with the \fB-u\fP or \fB-update\fP 
options, or the \fBupd\fP resource. This is not allowed.
.TP
.B Memory allocation error
The program could not get the memory it needs to operate. Maybe you have
specified a huge average count, or your system has very little memory
and/or swap space.

.SH BUGS
It requires Linux, since it needs the /proc filesystem, 
especially the /proc/net/dev file.

The format of the /proc/net/dev file has changed over time. Xnetload works
with 2.0.32+, 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels. If you have a kernel that
does not work with xnetload, please send the maintainer a listing of your
/proc/net/dev file, so the source can be updated.

Previous versions relied on a fixed buffer to read /proc/net/dev. This
sometimes caused problems for people with lots of network connections. As
of 1.11, the required memory is allocated dynamically.
