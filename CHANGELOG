- Added a fix for counter overrun.

version 1.7.0

version 1.6.0
- Added new options for setting the sample rate and average count.
- The source code is now in CVS.

version 1.5.1
- Updated the program to use the new /proc/net/dev layout in the 2.1.9x
  kernels. This also works with the 2.2.x kernels.

version 1.5.0
- Added a patch from Tony Mancill to issue
  IP-accounting rules if necessary. 
- Changed the graphs to display log10 of the packet/byte count.

version 1.4.2
- Changed my e-mail address. The old address (rsmit06@ibm.net) will become
  invalid in juli '98.

version 1.4.1
- Added patch level for bug-fixing :-)
- Fixed a out-of bounds string write bug in `read_ip_acct'. Thanks to
  Don May for spotting this.

version 1.4
- Fixed a bug in the code for calculating the average.
- Code separated into data-gathering and user-interface.
  (I'm thinking on adding a GTK+ interface for the next release, it would
   be a compile-time choice between Xaw/GTK+ interface)
- Modified it to make it work with 2.1.xx kernels.
  Thanks to Adrian Bridgett for sending in this patch.
- Added a fix to make it work with IP-aliases. Thanks to Raphael Wegmann
  for contributing it.
- It display bytes/s if IP-accounting is enabled.
  Tony Mancill submitted the basic code.
- Displays bytes/s on a kernel that supports it. (2.1.xx)
- The period over which the packet count is averaged can be changed in the
  makefile.

Version 1.3 employs some code for snooping on sockets. It wasn't publicly
released, since it was a CPU hog, and only works on AF_UNIX type sockets.

version 1.2:
- Fixed a bug in reading large packet counts.
  (Thanks to Rik Hemsley for spotting these.)
- Added library and include-file paths to the makefile. 
- Added Strip-Charts to display graphs of the network traffic.
- Added resources and command-line options to make it more configurable.

version 1.1:
- The program now responds to the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message (by terminating
  itself).
